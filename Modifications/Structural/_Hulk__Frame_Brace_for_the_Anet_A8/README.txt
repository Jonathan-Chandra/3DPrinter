# Summary

<H5>Story</H5>
One of the Anet A8 biggest drawbacks is the lack of stability in the X-axis. The higher you print the more layers may shift or waves may occur on the printed object.
For this reason I designed popular brackets to reduce the motion in X-axis: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1872162
However they will not completely eliminate the issue.
I therefore came up with a more effective means of reducing / eliminating any X-axis motion on the printer.

<H5>Goals / Highlights</H5>

- Eliminates any motion in x-axis direction.
- Is adjustable to fit any frame misalignment's.
- Can always be readjusted to compensate for a loosening frame due to vibrations.
- Uses less filament compared to other designs.
- Easy fits on a print bed.

<H5>Parts selection</H5>
Select files

- "Hulk_Right_Top_Arm_wBracket_Leo_N.stl" and
- "Hulk_Left_Top_Arm_wBracket_Leo_N.stl"

if you have my "Brackets" (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1872162) installed on your printer. The "Brackets" are not needed for the "Hulk" braces if you haven't already printed them. 
You will want to open the holes by using a sharp knife. After the braces have been mounted use a 3.5mm drill and then secure the part with screw, washer and nut (see picture).

If you are not using the Brackets then use files

- "Hulk_Right_Top_Arm_Leo_N.stl" and 
- "Hulk_Left_Top_Arm_Leo_N.stl"

for assembly.

Files

- "Hulk_Right_Bottom_Support_Leo_N.stl" and
- "Hulk_Left_Bottom_Support_Leo_N.stl"

will be need in either case.

<H5>Installation</H5>

You will need the following:
- 2 x M3x20 - 22mm screws MAX!
- 2 x M3 nuts
- 2 x 3mm washers

To install each brace you will want to insert the nut  into the upper brace and then place it into the lower holder. Next take the washer and screw and insert it into the assembly.
Remove the top screw on the lower acrylic support part on each side.
Now take the complete brace and start at the top by lodging the part to the acrylic frame and then push the lower frame brace onto the lower acrylic part. It should snap in.
Take the screws you removed earlier, optionally add washers and insert both screws to the lower acrylic supports.
The next step is to slowly and carefully turn the screw until the brace has a snug fit and the upper portion of the printer frame is no longer moving in X-axis.
<H4>Be very careful not to put too much force on the frame by over tightening the screw!! </H4> 

Please let me know if you have a problem with the design so I can improve it if necessary or you what new features to the design.

Also please post a picture with comments if you have made one.

Thanks.

Leo

<B>Update 2017.05.25</B>
Updated file "Hulk_Left_Bottom_Support_Leo_N" due to very little gap between the bottom support and the x-carriage stepper motor on some Anet frames.

<B>Update 2017.05.28</B>
Lengthened both Bottom_Support's by 0.2mm.

<B>Update 2017.05.30</B>
Removed holes on the bottom supports to avoid contact with the stepper motor if users 
selected screws that are to long.

<B>Update 2017.07.22</B>
Updated both lower supports by reducing height of the mount that support the top braces by -2.0mm. Use the appropriate plates (1mm, 1.5mm or 2mm) included in the file section if your braces are still too loose. Place plate inside the bottom support (picture #4) for height adjustment.

# Print Settings

Printer: Anet A8
Supports: Yes
Resolution: Your choice
Infill: 15%

Notes: 
For ease of print I would print with PLA.
If you are going to setup your printer in an enclosure then you will have to select another filament material like ABS.

Use 0.8mm wall thickness.

You might need to use "Rafts" to avoid warping depending on your printer setup.

Rotate the upper braces by 25Â° to fit the build plate and make sure you set your Slicer to 100% scale.

Here is a wonderfully made video about the Hulk braces and how to install them.
