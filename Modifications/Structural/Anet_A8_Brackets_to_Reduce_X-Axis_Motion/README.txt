Anet A8 Brackets to Reduce X-Axis Motion by Leo_N is licensed under the Creative Commons - Attribution - Non-Commercial license.

# Summary

These brackets are designed for the first series of Anet A8 printers with the goal of reducing X-axis motion particularly when printing in higher reigns of the printer.
To mount the brackets you will need to dismantle the display screen and remove the 4 pillar washers as they will not be needed. Place each bracket in the corners of the frame, remount the display screen and additionally fixate the brackets to the side support plates with M3x0 mm screws. Make sure the brackets are placed flat on the frame plates. It might be necessary to clean up the holes in the brackets to get a clean fit, depending on the quality of the print and the tolerances of your frame.

<H5>Important notice!</H5>
It seems newer models have been revised on the left side.
If you measure 68-69mm then use file "Anet_A8_Top_Left_Bracket_Leo.stl"
If you measure 72-73mm the use file "Top_Left_Frame_Bracket_Plus3mm_Leo.stl"

When mounting the brackets you must loosen the "screws" first. Mount the brackets as shown and fixate to the frame. Lastly re-tighten the "screws".

<H5>Read the whole text carefully. View all pictures for reference! Do not print these brackets if your printer dimensions differ!</H5>

Please let me know if you have a problem with the design so I can improve it if necessary or you what new features to the design.

Also please post a picture with comments if you have made one.

Thanks.

Leo

- For those wanting to use a spool holder on top the frame with these brackets may want to try these: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1908880">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1908880</a>

<H5>Update 2017.01.15</H5>
- User "BlackChart" had asked if I could add a panel to the right bracket. He provided the part as sketch for me. You can mount an ON/OFF switch and a switch for lights. The holes have a diameter of 5mm and can be enlarged by drilling a bigger hole.
