# Summary

Hey everyone. This is a remix of leos front Frame Brace. The only change I made is a scew hole with some space for it to mount it on a plate. Works best with my rear frame brace.

I got a lot of more stability while printing. The issue before was I changed to Igus bearings on thy y axis and the belts were slipping throgh cause my printer was not touching ground on every place he should. Now the prints are fine. Less vibration no more slipping through etc.

I used M3 wood screws with washers. Works best with the Rear frame Brace and my other upgrades to the Anet A8.
