## Introduction
This is a repository of all files and notes regarding a 3D printer I assembled.
It contains both information on modifications and firmware files with more to 
come.

**Printer Model:** Anet A8 \
**Print Material:** 1.75 mm PLA

**Settings:** 
<ul>
    <li>200 degrees Celsius hot-end
    <li>60 degrees Celsius Bed lined with 
    blue painter's tape
</ul>

## Why the Anet A8

The Anet A8 is a printer model that is extremely budget friendly at $139 USD at 
the time of creation of this repository (November 2020). It has ample support 
from the community with modifications to increase printing quality and safety. 
It is worth noting though, that safety concerns have been raised by the 
community. At the time of purchase, there was no 3D printer as price 
competitive as the Anet A8. However, presently I would recommend users consider 
looking into the Anet A8 plus, which addresses some of the concerns of the 
quality and safety issues wit hthe Anet A8.

The Anet A8 is a 3D printer *kit* which requires full assembly. From 
start-to-finsh it took me about 4-5 hours of assembly before bed leveling and 
other configurations to create accurate and clean prints. If you're a person 
that enjoys tinkering or learns through physical assembly of objects, then this 
is an ideal kit. If you want a printer that is a *plug and print*, then I would 
not recommend it.
